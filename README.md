To perform a GET request in Android Studio, you need to ensure your app has permission to access the internet by adding <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /> in the AndroidManifest.xml. Since network operations cannot run on the main thread, you typically perform them asynchronously using classes like AsyncTask, Thread, or modern libraries such as Retrofit or OkHttp. In the example provided, an AsyncTask executes a background task that opens an HTTP connection to a specified URL, sends a GET request, reads the response from the server, and then updates the user interface with the fetched data once the operation is complete. The response, often in JSON format, can then be displayed in a TextView or processed further as needed. This approach allows your Android app to retrieve data from external servers efficiently and update the UI accordingly.
